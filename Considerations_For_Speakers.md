Please note some key considerations:

### 1. Accommodation:

IMPORTANT: Please secure your accomodation as soon as possible.

There is always events taking place in the city each weekend. You can mitigate costs by booking something immediately.


### 2. The "Everyone Pays" Principle:

With a view to keeping the ticket prices low and accessible to everyone, PyCons around the world use the "Everybody Pays" principle.

We confirm that this principle is observed by PyCon Ireland, even applying it to the board of directors, and the management team.


This principle is well explained in the following post by Jesse Noller:

We point out that there are contingencies for financial aid assistance. Revert to myself if this is something you wish to discuss.


### 3. Youtube:


Please note that there will be video recording of the talks, which will then be published on Youtube under the Youtube licence:
